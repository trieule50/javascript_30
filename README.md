### Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
#### Learning Experience
From this project, I have learned two new materials. 
1. Data attributes

Data attributes allow coder to create any keys by putting `<data>` in front. This project uses data attributes to connect the audio to the div. 

2. Transitionend

Transitionend is an event that fired when a CSS trantion has completed. This project uses transitionend to remove the border of the keys. 

### Day 2 - CSS + JS Clock
#### Learning Experience
From this project, I solidify my understanding of transforms vs. transitions and the usage of the object Date. 

Transforms: Allows elements styled to be transformed in 2D or 3D space. In this project, transforms was used to allow the hands to rotate on its origin rather its midpoint.

Transitions: Allows property changes in CSS to occur smoothly over a specified duration. In this project, transitions was used to allow the hands to move from one degree to another.

Date: In this project, Date was called as a constructor as well as use serials of methods i.e `<getSeconds()>`, `<getMinutes()>`, `<getHours()>`

### Day 3 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS
#### Learning Experience
From this project, I have learned:
1. `<this.dataset>` is a read-only property of HTML element that provides read/write access to custom data attributes. `<this.dataset>` return an object.
