### Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
#### Learning Experience
From this project, I have learned two new materials. 
1. Data attributes

Data attributes allow coder to create any keys by putting `<data>` in front. This project uses data attributes to connect the audio to the div. 

2. Transitionend

Transitionend is an event that fired when a CSS trantion has completed. This project uses transitionend to remove the border of the keys.
